This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying {partner-product-name} on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start deploys an AEM OpenCloud architecture on the AWS Cloud with high availability features including https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling^],
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html[Elastic Load Balancing^] & https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html[Amazon CloudFront^].

The AEM OpenCloud Full-Set is deployed with the recommended highly-available configuration of two Author-Dispatcher, two Publish-Dispatcher and two AEM Publish instances across multiple availability zones in one AWS Region. Further Amazon Cloudwatch alarms are configured to monitor the average CPU utilization of the Publish-Dispatcher Auto Scaling group. The alarm is configured to scale out/in by one EC2 instance if the CPU Utilization is above/below 50%, by not exceeding the configured minimum (2) or maximum (4) size of the Publish-Dispatcher Auto Scaling Group. The Orchestrator application manages AEM replication and flush agents as instances are  created and terminated.
